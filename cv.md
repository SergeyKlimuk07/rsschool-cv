## **About Me:** ##
I am 28 years old, at the moment I work in a government job and really want to change it. Because I begin to understand that I am standing still, I am not developing, I am wasting my time stupidly. Why did I decide to choose the job of a programmer, because here you do not stand still, you constantly develop and learn something new, plus there is an incentive to learn other languages. I am willing to work hard and strive to reach new heights.
