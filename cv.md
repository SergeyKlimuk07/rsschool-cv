## **About Me:** ##
I am 28 years old, at the moment I work in a government job and really want to change it. Because I begin to understand that I am standing still, I am not developing, I am wasting my time stupidly. Why did I decide to choose the job of a programmer, because here you do not stand still, you constantly develop and learn something new, plus there is an incentive to learn other languages. I am willing to work hard and strive to reach new heights.

## **Work experience:** ##
In the process of study

## **Code example:** ##
```javascript
function convertText(string) {
  if (string === '') {
    return '';
  } else if (string[0] !== string[0].toUpperCase()) {
    return reverse(string);
  } else {
    return string;
  }
};
convertText ('Hello');
```
